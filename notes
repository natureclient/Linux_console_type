This software relies on a dictionary file, containing a list of words 
that the software will choose from when generating sentences of 
random words. There is a format that is expected of the dictionary
file. Every word is deliminated with a newline (white space is ignored).
That is, words are grouped by length, in ASCENDING order. Top of the
file has the shortest words and the bottom has the longest words. The
other requirement is that the size of the groupings for each word
length is the same. That is, if there are five three-letter words,
then there are five four-letter words, and so on.
